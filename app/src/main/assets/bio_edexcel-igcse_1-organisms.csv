23,Define the term <em>catalyst</em>,A substance that speeds up a reaction without being used or changed in the reaction itself,5,0
24,Describe the 'lock and key' model/theory,"The <b>substrate joins</b> on to the enzyme at the <b>active site</b>. The substrate needs to be the correct shape to fit the enzyme (like a key fitting a lock).<br><br>After the reaction, the product(s) are formed: substrates could have been split apart or joined together, for example. However, the <b>enzyme remains unchanged</b>.",5,0
25,How do changes in temperature affect the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction?,"At <b>low temperatures</b>, the enzyme and substrate particles have little energy, so the reaction takes place <b>slowly</b>.<br><br>Increasing the temperature gives them more energy, so the reaction speeds up.<br><br>If the temperature gets <b>too high</b>, the bonds holding the enzyme together break, so it loses its shape permanently - it becomes <b>denatured</b>. Since the substrate can no longer fit the active site of the denatured enzyme, the <b>reaction stops</b>.",5,0
26,What is the optimum temperature for most human enzymes?,37 &deg;C,5,0
27,What are enzymes used for?,Speeding up useful reactions in the body - <b>metabolic reactions</b>,5,0

29,"Apart from temperature, what other factor could potentially denature enzymes?",pH,6,1
30,What is the optimum pH of <em>pepsin</em>?,"pH 2 (suited to the acidic conditions in the stomach, where it breaks down proteins)",6,1
31,The enzyme <em>catalase</em> is used for breaking down...,<b>Hydrogen peroxide</b> (H2O2) into water and oxygen,6,0
32,How can <b>catalase</b> be used to observe the effect of temperature on enzyme activity?,"&bull; A test tube containing <b>hydrogen peroxide</b> solution (H2O2) and a source of <b>catalase</b> (a potato is a good example) is put in a water bath at a constant temperature <br>&bull; The amount of <b>oxygen produced</b> can be measured, which would show the <em>rate of reaction</em> <br>&bull; Changing the temperature (of the water bath) will affect the rate of reaction and thus the amount of oxygen produced",6,0
33,How can <em>amylase</em> be used to observe the effect of temperature on enzyme activity?,"<b>Starch</b> is broken down by the enzyme <b>amylase</b> <br><br>A couple of drops of <b>iodine solution</b> can be added to a starch and amylase solution, and the time for the iodine to change from <b>blue-black</b> to <b>brown-orange</b> (i.e. when the starch disappears) is measured <br><br>Changing the temperature of the reaction (e.g. using a water bath) will affect the time taken for the iodine to change color and for the starch to disappear (rate of reaction)",6,0

39,Give examples of experiments to show diffusion in non-living systems,"Examples include:<br><br>&bull; <b>Bromine gas</b> diffusing in air (bromine gas is brown, so you can see when it diffuses) <br><br>&bull; <b>Agar jelly</b> (made with <em>phenolphthalein</em> and <em>sodium hydroxide</em>) diffusing in acid (phenolphthalein goes from pink to colorless when it gets neutralised)",9,0
40,What experiment can show osmosis in a living system?,"&bull; A <b>potato is cut</b> into equally-sized cylinders (and their lengths measured) <br>&bull; There should be at least two beakers with <b>different concentrations of sugar solution</b> <br>&bull; The potato pieces are put in the beakers and left for a period of time (e.g. 1 hour) <br>&bull; After the time, pieces of potato that were longer than at the beginning would have drawn in water by <b>osmosis</b>; and shorter pieces would mean water was drawn out (by osmosis)",9,0
41,Describe an experiment to investigate osmosis in a non-living system,"&bull; Prepare some <b>Visking tubing</b> by tieing a wire to one end and a <b>glass tube</b> to the other <br>&bull; Fill the Visking tubing with <b>sugar solution</b> (using the tube) <br>&bull; Place the tubing in a beaker containing water, and <b>measure the level</b> of the sugar solution on the glass tube <br>&bull; Leave it for a period of time (e.g. 12 hours) and measure where the solution is along the glass tube <br>&bull; The level of liquid along the glass tube <b>should be higher</b> as water would be drawn in by osmosis",9,0
42,Define <em>active transport</em>,"The movement of particles <em>against a concentration gradient</em> (from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration), <em>using energy</em> released in respiration",10,0
43,"What three main factors affect the rate of diffusion, osmosis and active transport?","<b>Surface area to Volume ratio</b>: <br>A larger surface area to volume ratio means a higher rate of diffusion, osmosis and active transport <br><br><b>Temperature</b>: <br>Warmer particles have more energy so they can move in and out of cells faster <br><br><b>Concentration gradient</b>: <br>A higher concentration gradient (larger difference in concentration) means a higher rate of diffusion and osmosis. Concentration gradients <em>don't affect active transport</em>",10,0
