1,Define <b>respiration</b>,"The process of <b>releasing energy</b> from <b>glucose</b>, which happens constantly <b>in every living cell</b>",28,0
2,What are the two types of respiration?,<b>Aerobic</b> and <b>anaerobic</b>,28,0
3,Energy in respiration is released as...,<b>Chemical energy</b> and <b>heat</b>,28,0
4,The <b>chemical energy</b> released from respiration is used for what?,It's for things like <b>creating large molecules</b> from smaller ones (e.g. proteins from amino acids) and <b>constract muscles</b>. <br><br>The <b>heat energy</b> helps to <b>maintain</b> a steady <b>body temperature</b>.,28,0
5,<b>Aerobic</b> respiration happens when...,There's <b>plenty of oxygen</b> available,28,0
6,State the equation for <b>aerobic</b> respiration,Glucose + Oxygen &rarr; Carbon dioxide + Water (+ Energy) <br><br>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O (+ Energy),28,0
7,When does <b>anaerobic</b> respiration occur?,"When you do <b>vigorous exercise</b>, your body can't supply enough <b>oxygen</b> to your muscles for aerobic respiration - so your muscles have to start <b>respiring anaerobically</b>.",28,0
8,Is <b>anaerobic</b> respiration better than <b>aerobic</b>? Why?,"No - <b>aerobic</b> respiration is the best way to respire. <br><br><b>An</b>aerobic respiration releases <b>less energy</b>, where glucose is only <b>partially</b> broken down. <b>Lactic acid</b> is also produced, which builds up in the muscles - it gets <b>painful</b> and leads to <b>cramp</b>.",28,0
9,What is the equation for <b>anaerobic</b> respiration in <b>animals</b>?,Glucose &rarr; Lactic Acid (+ Energy),28,0
10,How is <b>anaerobic</b> respiration different in <b>plants</b>?,"Plants can respire anaerobically, but they produce <b>ethanol</b> and <b>carbon dioxide</b> instead of lactic acid.",28,0
11,What's the equation for <b>anaerobic</b> respiration in <b>plants</b>?,Glucose &rarr; Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide (+ Energy),28,0
12,What indicator can detect <b>carbon dioxide</b> production?,Hydrogen carbonate solution,29,1
13,How can you show the living organisms produce carbon dioxide?,"&bull; Soak <b>dried beans</b> in water so they start to <b>germinate</b> and therefore <b>respire</b> <br>&bull; <b>Boil</b> a similar-sized bunch of dried beans to <b>kill</b> them and make them <b>stop respiring</b>. These dead beans will be the <b>control</b>. <br>&bull; Put <b>hydrogen carbonate indicator</b> and a platform made of <b>gauze</b> into two <b>test tubes</b> <br>&bull; <b>Seal</b> the test tubes with a <b>rubber bung</b> <br>&bull; Leave the apparatus for a <b>set period</b> of <b>time</b> <br>&bull; The carbon dioxide produced by the germinating beans would have affected the <b>hydrogen carbonate</b> indicator, turning it <b>yellow</b>",29,1
14,Describe an experiment to measure the heat produced by respiration,"&bull; Prepare <b>two sets of beans</b> (soaked/germinating and boiled/dead) &bull; Add each set to a <b>vacuum flask</b>, making sure there's some <b>air</b> left for the beans to <b>respire aerobically</b> <br>&bull; Place a <b>thermometer</b> into each flash and seal the top with <b>cotton wool</b> <br>&bull; Record the <b>temperature</b> of each flask daily for once a week <br>&bull; When the germinating beans <b>respire</b> and produce <b>heat</b>, the <b>test flask's temperature</b> (the one with the germinating beans) will <b>increase</b> compared to the control flask (with the boiled beans)",29,1
15,Movement of gases in plants happens by...,Diffusion,30,0
16,How does diffusion control the movement of gases in plants?,"&bull; Photosynthesis means the plant uses a lot of <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b> so there's hardly any inside the leaf. This makes <b>more</b> CO<sub>2</sub> move into the leaf by <b>diffusion</b> (high to low concentration) <br><br>At the same time, <b>oxygen</b> is being <b>made</b> as a waste product of photosynthesis. Some of it is used in <b>respiration</b> and the rest <b>diffuses out</b> through the <b>stomata</b> (high to low concentration)",30,0
17,How does the net exchange of gases depend on <b>light intensity</b>?,"<b>Photosynthesis</b> only happens during the <b>day</b> (when light is available), but plants <b>respire all the time</b> (to get energy to live). <br><br>So, during the <b>day</b>, plants <b>release</b> more <b>oxygen</b> and <b>use up</b> more <b>carbon dioxide</b>. <br><br>At <b>night</b>, they <b>release</b> more <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>take in</b> more <b>oxygen</b> (because they do respiration but not photosynthesis at night)",30,1
18,How are leaves adapted for efficient gas exchange?,"&bull; Leaves are <b>broad</b> (large surface area for <b>diffusion</b>) <br>&bull; They're also <b>thin</b> so gases travel a <b>short distance</b> to reach the cells <br>&bull; <b>Air spaces</b> inside the leaf (spongy mesophyll layer) lets gases move easily and increases surface area for <b>gas exchange</b> <br>&bull; Little holes called <b>stomata</b> (at the lower surface) lets gases diffuse in and out, and also allow <b>water</b> to escape (<b>transpiration</b>) <br>&bull; Stomata <b>close</b> in the dark (when photosynthesis stops) so <b>water can't escape</b> (stops the plant drying out). They also close when supplies of water <b>dry up</b>. <br>&bull; The <b>opening</b> and <b>closing</b> of stomata is <b>controlled</b> by cells that surround them (called <b>guard cells</b>)",30,0
19,Which indicator is used to show changes in <b>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration</b>?,Hydrogen carbonate indicator,31,1
20,How does <b>hydrogen carbonate</b> indicator show changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration?,"If CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the air <b>increases</b> the indicator becomes more <b>yellow</b> <br><br>If it <b>decreases</b>, it becomes <b>purple</b>.",31,1
21,Describe an experiment to show how light affects gas exchange,#see-guide,31,1
22,Describe what happens when you breathe in,&bull; Intercostal muscles and diaphragm <b>contract</b> <br>&bull; Thorax volume <b>increases</b> <br>&bull; This decreases the pressure drawing air <b>in</b>,32,0
23,What happens when you breathe out?,&bull; Intercostal muscles and diaphragm <b>relax</b> <br>&bull; Thorax volume <b>decreases</b> <br>&bull; Air is forced <b>out</b>,32,0
24,How can you investigate the effect of exercise on breathing rate?,"&bull; Sit still for <b>five minutes</b> and <b>take your pulse</b> <br>&bull; Now do <b>exercise</b> for a period of time (e.g. 4 mins) <br>&bull; Once you stop, <b>count your pulse</b> again <br>&bull; You should see that exercise <b>increases breathing rate</b> because <b>muscles respire more</b> during exercise. <br>&bull; This is because they need to be supplied with <b>more oxygen</b> and have <b>more oxygen</b> removed <br>&bull; Remember to <b>control</b> all other variables that may affect the results (e.g. time spent exercising, temperature of the room, etc.)",32,0
25,Where specifically does gas exchange occur?,In the <b>alveoli</b (the millions of little air sacs in the lungs),33,0
26,How does gas exchange occur in the alveoli?,"&bull; <b>Blood</b> passing next to the alveoli has returned from the rest of the body, so it contains <b>lots</b> of <b>carbon dioxide</b> and little oxygen. <br>&bull; <b>Oxygen</b> diffuses <b>out</b> of the <b>alveolus</b> (high concentration) into the <b>blood</b> (low concentration). <br>&bull; <b>Carbon dioxide</b> diffuses <b>out</b> of the <b>blood</b> (high concentration) into the <b>alveolus</b> (low concentration) to be breathed out.",33,0
27,How are alveoli specialised for gas exchange?,&bull; The huge number of microscopic alveoli gives the lungs an <b>enormous surface area</b> <br>&bull; There's a <b>moist lining</b> for gases to <b>dissolve</b> in <br>&bull; Very <b>thin walls</b> (one cell thick) mean the gas doesn't have far to diffuse <br>&bull; <b>Great blood supply</b> maintains a high concentration gradient <br>&bull; The walls are <b>permeable</b> so gases can diffuse across easily,33,0
28,What problems can smoking tobacco cause?,"&bull; Smoking <b>damages</b> the walls inside the <b>alveoli</b> (reducing <b>surface area</b> for gas exchange), leading to diseases like <b>emphysema</b>. <br>The <b>tar</b> in cigarettes damages the <b>cilia</b> (little hairs) in your lungs and trachea. This could make <b>chest infections</b> more likely. <br>&bull; Tar <b>irritates</b> the <b>bronchi</b> and <b>bronchioles</b>, encouraging more mucus to be produced which can't be cleared very well by damage cilia - this causes <b>smoker's cough</b> and <b>chronic bronchitis</b>. <br>&bull; <b>Carbon monoxide</b> in cigarette smoke <b>reduces</b> the amount of <b>oxygen</b> the blood can carry. <br>&bull; To make up for this, <b>heart rate increases</b> which leads to an increase in <b>blood pressure</b>. <br>&bull; High blood pressure <b>damages artery walls</b> making <b>blood clots</b> more likely and increases the risk of <b>coronary heart disease</b> <br>&bull; Tobacco smoke also contains <b>carcinogens</b> - chemicals that can lead to <b>cancer</b>.",33,0
29,How do cilia and mucus prevent chest infections?,"<b>Cilia</b> (little hairs) and <b>mucus</b> catch <b>dust and bacteria</b>, and keep the <b>trachea clear</b> by sweeping mucus back towards the mouth.",33,0
