1,What is a magnetic field?,A <b>region</b> where <b>magnetic materials</b> (e.g. iron) experience a <b>force</b>.,63,0
2,In which direction do magnetic field lines always point?,<b>North</b> to <b>south</b>.,63,0
3,Give examples of two ways to observe magnetic field patterns,"<b>Compasses</b>:<br>You can use multiple compasses to record the direction of magnetic field lines near a magnet <br><br><b>Iron filings</b>:<br>Put the magnet under a piece of paper and scatter iron filings on top. You will see the filings have aligned themselves to various positions, which is the magnetic field pattern.",63,0
4,"In magnets, how do like poles and opposite poles react to each other?",Like poles <b>repel</b> and opposite poles <b>attract</b>,63,1
5,Describe the magnetic field patterns of repelling bar magnets,#see-guide,63,1
6,What does the magnetic field pattern look like in two attracting bar magnets?,#see-guide,63,1
7,Describe <b>induced magnetism</b>,"When a magnet is brought <b>near</b> a magnetic material, then that material acts as a <b>magnet</b>. This magnetism has been <b>induced</b> by the original magnet. <br><br>The <b>closer</b> the magnet and the magnetic material get, the <b>stronger</b> the induced magnetism will be.",63,1
8,A current-carrying wire creates...,A magnetic field,64,0
9,"In a current-carrying wire, what two factors affect the magnetic field and how?","The <b>larger</b> the electric current, the <b>stronger</b> the magnetic field. <br><br>The <b>direction</b> of the <b>magnetic field</b> depends on the <b>direction</b> of the current.",64,0
10,Describe the magnetic field pattern around a <b>straight wire</b>,"There is a magnetic field around a <b>straight</b>, <b>current-carrying</b> wire, made up of <b>concentric circles</b> with the wire in the centre.",64,1
11,What does the magnetic field around a <b>flat circular coil</b> look like?,The magnetic field in the <b>centre</b> of this wire is similar to that of a <b>bar magnet</b>. <br><br>There are concentric <b>ellipses</b> of magnetic field lines <b>around</b> the coil.,64,1
12,Define <b>solenoid</b>,A cylindrical <b>coil of wire</b> (which acts as a magnet when an electric current is passed through),64,1
13,Describe the magnetic field pattern around a <b>solenoid</b>,"The magnetic field is <b>strong</b> and <b>uniform</b>. <br><br><b>Outside</b> the coil, the field is just like the one around a <b>bar magnet</b>, so the <b>ends</b> of the solenoid act like the <b>'north'</b> and <b>'south'</b> of a bar magnet. <br><br>This type of magnet is callled an <b>electromagnet</b>.",64,1
14,Give an example of a <b>soft</b> magnetic material,Iron,64,1
15,Name a <b>hard</b> magnetic material,Steel,64,1
16,What does it mean for a magnetic material to be <b>'soft'</b>,It <b>loses</b> its induced magnetism <b>quickly</b>.,64,1
17,"If a magnetic material keeps its induced magnetism permanently, it is...",A <b>hard</b> magnetic material,64,1
18,What material is used in <b>transformers</b> and why?,"<b>Iron</b> because it is a <b>soft</b> magnetic material. <br><br>In transformers, it needs to magnetise and demagnetise 50x per second (mains electricity in the UK is 50 Hz).",64,1
19,How can you increase the <b>strength</b> of the magnetic field around a solenoid?,Adding a magnetically <b>'soft' iron core</b> through the middle of the coil.,64,1
20,The motor effect can happen when...,You put a <b>current-carrying wire</b> in a <b>magnetic field</b>,65,0
21,What is the motor effect?,"When a <b>current-carrying wire</b> is put between magnetic poles, the two <b>magnetic fields</b> affect one another. <br><br>The result is a <b>force</b> on the wire, which can cause the <b>wire</b> to <b>move</b>.",65,0
22,Why does the motor effect work?,"<b>Charged particles</b> (e.g. electrons in a current) moving through a magnetic field will experience a <b>force</b>, as long as they're not moving parallel to the field lines.",65,1
23,A current in a magnetic field experiences <b>full force</b> when...,"The <b>wire</b> has to be at <b>90&deg;</b> to the <b>magnetic field</b>. <br><br>If the wire runs <b>along</b> the <b>magnetic field</b>, it won't experience <b>any force at all</b>. At angles in between, it'll feel <b>some force.",65,0
24,"In a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field, in which direction does the force act?",The force always acts in the <b>same direction</b> relative to the <b>magnetic field</b> of the magnets and the <b>direction of the current</b> in the wire.,65,0
25,How can you show the <b>direction of the force</b> of a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field?,"Apply a current to a set of <b>rails</b> inside a <b>horseshoe magnet</b>. A bar is placed on the rails, which <b>completes the circuit</b>. This generates a <b>force</b> that <b>rolls the bar</b> along the rails.",65,0
26,The <b>magnitude</b> (strength) of the force of a current-carrying wire in magnetic field depends on...,The strength of the <b>magnetic field</b> or the amount of <b>current</b>,65,0
27,How can the <b>direction</b> of the force of a current-carrying wire in magnetic field be reversed?,<b>Reversing</b> the <b>current</b> or the <b>magnetic field</b>,65,0
28,What is Fleming's left-hand rule?,Using your left-hand: <br><br>&bull; <b>F</b>irst finger = direction of the <b>F<b>ield <br>&bull; <b>Se<b>C</b>ond finger = direction of the <b>C</b>urrent <br>&bull; Thu<b>M</b> = direction of the force (<b>M</b>otion),65,0
29,What <b>four</b> factors can speed up an electric motor?,&bull; More current <br>&bull; More turns on the coil <br>&bull; Stronger magnetic field <br>&bull; A soft iron core in the coil,66,0
