1,How can you artificially create the ideal conditions for <b>photosynthesis</b>?,"&bull; Keeping plants <b>enclosed</b> in a glasshouse to keep them free from <b>pests</b> and <b>diseases</b> <br>&bull; Supplying <b>artificial light</b> after the Sun goes down <br>&bull; Glasshouses <b>trap</b> the Sun's <b>heat</b> to keep plants <b>warm</b> (you could also use a <b>heater</b>) <br>&bull; Increasing the level of <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b> (by using a <b>paraffin heater</b>, which makes carbon dioxide as a by-product when heating)",75,0
2,What do fertilisers do?,"Plants need nutrients, and sometimes, nutrients are <b>missing</b> from the soil perhaps because they've been used up by a <b>previous crop</b> <br><br>Fertilisers <b>replace</b> these or provide <b>more</b> of them - this helps to increase <b>crop yield</b>",75,0
3,What are <b>pesticides</b> and what do they do?,"A form of <b>chemical pest control</b>, often poisonous to humans. <br><br>So they need to be used carefully to keep the amount of pesticide in <b>food</b> below a <b>safe level</b>. Some pesticides also <b>harm other wildlife</b>.",75,0
4,Describe <b>biological control</b>,"An alternative to pesticides, it means using <b>other organisms</b> to reduce the numbers of pests, either by <b>encouraging wild organisms</b> or <b>adding new ones</b> <br><br>These organisms could be <b>predators, parasites</b>, or <b>disease-causing</b>",75,0
5,What are the advantages and disadvantages of biological control?,"Biological control can have a <b>longer-lasting</b> effect than pesticides, and be <b>less harmful</b> to wildlife <br><br>However, it can also cause <b>problems</b> - e.g. cane toads were introduced in Australia to eat beetles, but they're now a major pest themselves as they poison the native species that eat them",75,0
6,Define <b>fermentation</b>,When <b>microorganisms</b> break sugars down to release energy - usually by <b>anaerobic respiration</b>,76,1
7,How is <b>yoghurt</b> made?,&bull; The <b>equipment</b> is first <b>sterilised</b> <br>&bull; Milk is then <b>pasteurised</b> (heated to 72 &deg;C for 15 secs) again to kill microorganisms before being <b>cooled</b> <br>&bull; <b><em>Lactobacillus</em> bacteria</b> are added and the mixture is <b>incubated</b> (heated to 40 &deg;C) in a vessel called a <b>fermenter</b> <br>&bull; The bacteria ferment the <b>lactose sugar</b> in milk to form <b>lactic acid</b> <br>&bull; The acid causes the milk to <b>clot</b> and <b>solidify</b> into <b>yoghurt</b>,76,1
8,Microorganisms can be grown in large containers called...,<b>Fermenters</b> <br><br>...which are full of liquid '<b>culture medium</b>'  in which microorganisms can grow and reproduce,76,1
9,Microorganisms can be grown in <b>fermenters</b> to make...,Useful stuff like <b>penicillin</b> or <b>insulin</b>,76,1
10,Label a diagram of a fermenter,#see-guide,76,1
11,How can we use <b>yeast</b> for <b>brewing beer</b>?,"&bull; Get the <b>sugar out</b> of the grain <br>&bull; <b>Yeast</b> is <b>added</b> and the mixture is <b>incubated</b> (warmed up). The yeast <b>ferments</b> the <b>sugar</b> into <b>alcohol</b>. The fermenting vessels stop <b>unwanted microorganisms</b> and <b>air getting in</b>. <br>&bull; The beer is <b>drawn off</b> through a tap. <br>&bull; The <b>beer</b> is then <b>pasteurised</b> (heated to <b>kill any yeast</b> left in the beer and stop fermentation).<sup>*</sup> <br><br><sup>*</sup><small><i>Beer tastes better unpasteurised and aged in the right conditions, but big breweries pasteurise it as there's a <b>risk</b> unpasteurised beer will <b>spoil</b> if it's not stored in the right conditions after being sold.</i></small>",77,0
12,"When brewing beer, how exactly do you get <b>sugar out</b> of the grain?",&bull; Beer is made from <b>grain</b> - usually <b>barley</b> <br>&bull; The barley grains <b>germinate</b> for a few days so the <b>starch</b> in the grains is broken down into <b>sugar</b> by <b>enzymes</b>. Then the grains are <b>dried</b> in a kiln. This is called <b>malting</b> <br>&bull; The malted grain is <b>mashed up</b> and the water is added to produce a <b>sugary solution</b> with lots of bits in it. This is then sieved to remove the bits. <br>&bull; <b>Hops</b> are added to the mixture to give beer its <b>bitter flavour</b>,77,0
13,"When brewing beer, how exactly does <b>fermentation slow down</b>?","&bull; The <b>rising concentration of alcohol (ethanol)</b> in the fermentation mixture due to <b>anaerobic respiration</b> eventually starts to <b>kill</b> the <b>yeast</b>. As the yeast dies, fermentation <b>slows</b> down. <br>&bull; <b>Different species</b> of yeast can tolerate <b>different levels of alcohol</b>. Some species can be used to produce strong beer with a high concentration of alcohol.",77,0
14,How can you show that <b>temperature</b> affects the respiration rate of <b>yeast</b>?,"&bull; Mix some <b>sugar</b>, <b>yeast</b> and <b>distilled water</b>, then add the mixture to a <b>test tube</b>. <br>&bull; Attach a <b>bung</b> with a tube leading to a second test tube of <b>water</b> (or a gas syringe if you want to increase accuracy). <br>&bull; Place the tube containing the yeast mixture in a <b>water bath</b> at a <b>certain temperature</b>. <br>&bull; Leave the tube to warm up for a bit and <b>measure</b> the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production (which shows the <b>respiration rate</b>) <br>&bull; <b>Repeat</b> this but at <b>different temperatures</b> (respiration is controlled by <b>enzymes</b>, so changing temperature should change respiration rate)",77,0
15,What is the <b>basic process</b> involved in selective breeding?,"&bull; From your <b>existing stock</b> select ones with the <b>best characteristics</b> <br>&bull; <b>Breed them</b> with each other <br>&bull; Select the <b>best offspring</b> and <b>breed them together</b> <br>&bull; Continue this process over <b>several generations</b>, and the desirable trait gets <b>stronger</b>. In farming, this will give the farmer gradually better yields.",78,0
16,What are <b>fish farms</b>?,"Big <b>enclosures</b> or <b>tanks</b> where fish are raised for food, in a controlled way that's designed to produce <b>as many fish as possible</b>",79,0
17,Describe <b>fish farming</b>,"&bull; Fish are kept in <b>cages</b> in the <b>sea</b> (to stop them using as much energy for swimming, and to <b>protect</b> them from being eaten by other animals) <br>&bull; They're fed a <b>diet</b> of food pellets <b>carefully controlled</b> to <b>maximise</b> the amount of energy they get (and thus growth) <br>&bull; Young fish are reared in <b>special tanks</b> to ensure many survive as possible",79,0
18,Define <b>interspecific predation</b>,Being eaten by other animals,79,0
19,"When fish farming, why is it important to keep younger fish separate from bigger fish?",This makes sure that the big fish <b>don't eat the little ones</b> (intraspecific predation).,79,0
20,Define <b>intraspecific predation</b>,Where organisms eat individuals of the same species,79,0
21,What are some disadvantages to keeping fish in cages (fish farming) and how can they be resolved?,"Fish kept in cages are more prone to <b>disease</b> and <b>parasites</b>. <br><br>For example, <b>sea lice</b> can be treated with <b>pesticides</b> which kill them. To <b>avoid pollution</b> from chemical pesticides, <b>biological pest control</b> can be used instead.",79,0
22,What are the advantages to fish farming in tanks?,"&bull; The <b>water</b> can be <b>monitored</b> to check the <b>temperature, pH</b> and <b>oxygen</b> is OK <br>&bull; It's easy to control <b>how much food</b> is supplied and give <b>exactly the right sort</b> of food <br>&bull; The water can be <b>removed</b> and <b>filtered</b> to remove <b>waste food</b> and <b>fish poo</b>, which keeps the water <b>clean</b> and avoids <b>pollution</b> wherever the water ends up.",79,0
23,What can <b>restriction enzymes</b> do?,Recognise <b>specific sequences</b> of DNA and <b>cut the DNA</b> at these points,80,0
24,What is the function of <b>ligase enzymes</b>?,They are used to join <b>two pieces of DNA</b> together,80,0
25,What is <b>recombinant DNA</b>?,<b>Two different bits</b> of DNA stuck together,80,0
26,What is a <b>vector</b> in genetic engineering?,Something used to <b>transfer DNA</b> into a <b>cell</b>. <br><br>There are two sorts - <b>plasmids</b> and <b>viruses</b>.,80,0
27,How can <b>plasmids</b> and <b>viruses</b> be used to insert DNA into other organisms?,"Plasmids are <b>small, circular</b> molecules of DNA that can be <b>transferred</b> between <b>bacteria</b> <br><br>Viruses <b>insert</b> DNA into the organisms they <b>infect</b>",80,0
28,Define <b>transgenic</b> (with an example),They contain <b>genes transferred from another species</b> <br><br>(e.g. bacteria that contain the gene for human insulin are transgenic),80,1
29,What are the advantages for <b>genetically modified</b> crops (GM crops)?,Increasing <b>food production</b> in different ways <br><br>&bull; Making them <b>insect-resistant</b> <br>&bull; Making them <b>herbicide-resistant</b>,80,0
30,What are some concerns over growing genetically modified crops?,&bull; <b>Transplanted genes</b> may get out into the <b>environment</b> - e.g. a herbicide resistance gene may be picked up by weeds creating a new 'superweed' variety <br>&bull; GM crops could adversely affect <b>food chains</b>,80,0
31,Describe the steps involved in <b>micropropagation</b>,"&bull; A plant with <b>desirable characteristics</b> is selected to be cloned <br>&bull; Small pieces (<b>explants</b>) are taken from the tips of the stems and the side shoots of this plant <br>&bull; The explants are <b>sterilised</b> to kill any microorganisms <br>&bull; They're then grown <b><em>in vitro</em></b> (placed in a <b>petri dish</b> containing a <b>nutrient medium</b>). The medium has all the nutrients the explants need to grow, and also <b>growth hormones</b>. <br>&bull; Explant cells <b>divide</b> and <b>grow</b> into a <b>small plant</b>. <br>&bull; The small plants are taken out of the medium, <b>planted in soil</b> and put into <b>glasshouses</b> - they'll develop into plants that are <b>genetically identical</b> to the <b>original plant</b> - so they share the <b>same characteristics</b>/",81,0
32,How can an adult mammal (e.g. a sheep) be cloned?,"&bull; The <b>nucleus</b> of a sheep's <b>egg cell</b> was removed, creating an <b>enucleated cell</b> (i.e. without a nucleus) <br>&bull; A <b>diploid</b> nucleus was <b>inserted</b> in its place. This was a nucleus from a mature udder cell of a <b>different sheep</b>. <br>&bull; The cell was <b>stimulated</b> (by an electric shock) so that it started <b>dividing by mitosis</b>, as if it was a normal <b>fertilised egg</b>. <br>&bull; The dividing cell was <b>implanted</b> into the <b>uterus</b> of another sheep to develop until it was ready to be born. <br>&bull; The result was a <b>clone</b> of the sheep that the <b>udder cell</b> came from.",81,0
33,What are some possible <b>uses</b> for cloned <b>transgenic</b> animals?,&bull; Animals that can produce <b>medicines</b> in their <b>milk</b> could be cloned. <br>&bull; Animals that have organs suitable for <b>organ transplantation</b> into humans could be developed by <b>genetic engineering</b> and then <b>cloned</b> in the same way.,81,1
34,What are the main beoefits of cloning animals?,"The useful genetic characteristics are <b>always passed on</b> - this doesn't always happen with <b>breeding</b>. <br><br>Farmers also don't have to <b>wait</b> until the <b>breeding season</b>, and <b>infertile</b> animals can be cloned.",81,1
35,What are some of the risks of cloning animals?,"&bull; There's evidence that cloned animals might <b>not</b> be as <b>healthy</b> as normal ones. Embryos formed by cloning from adult cells often <b>don't develop normally</b>. <br>&bull; Cloning is a <b>new</b> science that might have consequences that we're <b>not yet aware</b> of. It's also <b>difficult</b>, <b>time-consuming</b>, and <b>expensive</b>.",81,1
