21,Define <b>terminal velocity</b>,"When an object falls freely, there is <b>more force</b> accelerating them than resistance slowing them down. As <b>velocity</b> increases, resistance <b>builds up</b>. <br><br>Eventually, the <b>resistance force</b> will be <b>equal</b> to the <b>accelerating force</b> and then it won't be able to accelerate any more. It will have reached its maximum velocity, or <b>terminal velocity</b>.",6,0
22,"Explain why the hammer and feather, dropped simultaneously, hit the ground at the same time on the Moon?","The <b>accelerating force</b> acting on <b>all falling objects</b> is <b>gravity</b> and it would make them all accelerate at the <b>same rate</b> if it wasn't for <b>air resistance</b>. <br><br>On the Moon, where there's <b>no air</b> the hammer and feather <b>hit the ground together</b>, whereas on Earth, the <b>air resistance</b> causes things to fall at <b>different speeds</b> (terminal velocity depends on an object's drag vs weight).",6,0
23,"With reference to terminal velocity, describe why parachutes are important for skydivers","If the skydiver has no parachute, he has a <b>small area</b> and force equal to his <b>weight</b> pulling him down. But when the parachute is <b>open</b> there's more <b>air resistance</b> and the same force pulling him down. <br><br>His <b>terminal velocity</b> decreases significantly, so he can land safely.",6,0
24,State the <b>first</b> law of motion,"<b>Balanced forces mean no change in velocity</b> <br><br><i>If the forces on an object are <b>balanced</b>, it will carry on moving at the <b>same velocity</b> (this includes staying still).</i>",7,0

41,What is a <b>moment</b>?,"The <b>force</b> on a spanner causes a <b>turning effect</b> (or <b>moment</b>). <br><br>Using a longer spanner, the same force can exert a <b>larger</b> moment because the <b>distance</b> from the pivot is greater.",12,0
