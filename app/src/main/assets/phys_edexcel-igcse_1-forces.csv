1,What's the difference between <b>speed</b> and <b>velocity</b>?,"<b>Speed is just <b>how fast</b> you're going (e.g. 30 mph or 20 m/s) with no regard to the direction. <br><br><b>Velocity</b> however must <b>also</b> have the <b>direction</b> specified (e.g. 30 mph north, or 20 m/s, 060&deg;).",1,0
2,What formula can you use to calculate average speed?,Average speed = Distance moved &divide; Time taken,1,0
3,Define <b>acceleration</b>,"<b>How quickly</b> the velocity is <b>changing</b>. <br>It can be a change in speed, change in direction, or both (but you only need to worry about change in speed for calculations).",1,0
4,How can you calculate acceleration?,Acceleration = Change in velocity &divide; Time taken,1,0
5,"On a distance-time graph, the gradient represents...",Speed,2,0
6,A flat (horizontal) line on a distance-time graph shows...,Where speed has <b>stopped</b>,2,0
7,Curves on a distance-time graph show...,Acceleration or deceleration,2,0
8,How can you calculate speed from a distance-time graph?,The <b>gradient</b> (i.e. vertical &divide; horizontal),2,0
9,How is acceleration shown on a velocity-time graph?,It's the <b>gradient</b>,2,0
10,Flat/horizontal lines on a velocity-time graph represent...,Steady speed,2,0
11,"On a velocity-time graph, a curve means...",Changing acceleration,2,0
12,How can you calculate acceleration from a velocity-time graph?,The <b>gradient</b> (i.e. vertical &divide; horizontal),2,0
13,What is <b>gravity</b>?,"The <b>force of attraction</b> between <b>all masses</b>. <br><br>&bull; It makes things <b>accelerate</b> towards the <b>ground</b> on the surface of a planet <br>&bull; It gives everything a <b>weight</b> <br>&bull; It keeps planets, moons, etc. in their <b>orbits</b>. <br>&bull; An orbit is a <b>balance</b> between the <b>forward</b> motion of the objet and the force of gracity pulling it <b>inwards</b>.",3,0
14,Describe the difference between <b>weight</b> and <b>mass</b>,"<b>Mass</b> is the <b>amount of 'stuff'</b> in an object - for any given object, this will be the same anywhere in the Universe <br><br><b>Weight</b> is caused by the <b>pull</b> of gravity. An object's weight will be different on different planets.",3,0
15,State the formula linking weight and mass,Weight = mass &times; gravitational field strength,3,0
16,List at least five different types of force,"&bull; <b>Gravity</b> acting straight downwards <br>&bull; <b>Reaction force</b> from a surface, usually acting straight upwards <br>&bull; <b>Electrostatic force</b> between two charged objects (direction depends on the type of charges) <br>&bull; <b>Thrust</b> when an engine or rocket speeds something up <br>&bull; <b>Drag</b> / <b>air resistance</b> / <b>friction</b> slows an object down <br>&bull; <b>Lift</b> due to an aeroplane wing <br>&bull; <b>Tension</b> in a rope or cable",4,0
17,Friction occurs in three main ways. What are they?,&bull; Friction between <b>solid surfaces</b> which are gripping (static friction) <br>&bull; Friction between <b>solid surfaces</b> which are <b>sliding</b> past each other <br>&bull; <b>Resistance</b> or 'drag' from <b>fluids</b> (liquids or gases - e.g. air).,4,0
18,How can you reduce friction between solid surfaces?,Putting a <b>lubricant</b> like <b>oil</b> between the surfaces,4,0
19,How is friction/resistance/drag an issue in cars?,"When cars move, there is <b>air resistance</b> which can slow things down. <br><br>Also, in <b>fluids</b> (like air), <b>friction always increases as the speed increases</b>",4,0
20,Describe an experiment to investiage the motion of a toy car on a ramp,"&bull; Mark a <b>line</b> on the ramp to make sure the car starts from the <b>same points</b> each time <br>&bull; Measure the <b>distances</b> between light gates (place one at the start line, one at the end of the ramp/start of the runway, and another at the end of the runway). You need this to help with finding average speed. <br>&bull; The light gate should be connected to a <b>computer</b>. So, when the car passes through each <b>light gate</b>, a beam of light is broken and a <b>time</b> is recorded. <br>&bull; <b>Repeat</b> to find an <b>average time</b> it takes for the car to reach each light gate (more reliable results) <br>&bull; Find the <b>average speed</b> using the distance between the gates and average time taken",5,0
21,Define <b>terminal velocity</b>,"When an object falls freely, there is <b>more force</b> accelerating them than resistance slowing them down. As <b>velocity</b> increases, resistance <b>builds up</b>. <br><br>Eventually, the <b>resistance force</b> will be <b>equal</b> to the <b>accelerating force</b> and then it won't be able to accelerate any more. It will have reached its maximum velocity, or <b>terminal velocity</b>.",6,0
22,"Explain why the hammer and feather, dropped simultaneously, hit the ground at the same time on the Moon?","The <b>accelerating force</b> acting on <b>all falling objects</b> is <b>gravity</b> and it would make them all accelerate at the <b>same rate</b> if it wasn't for <b>air resistance</b>. <br><br>On the Moon, where there's <b>no air</b> the hammer and feather <b>hit the ground together</b>, whereas on Earth, the <b>air resistance</b> causes things to fall at <b>different speeds</b> (terminal velocity depends on an object's drag vs weight).",6,0
23,"With reference to terminal velocity, describe why parachutes are important for skydivers","If the skydiver has no parachute, he has a <b>small area</b> and force equal to his <b>weight</b> pulling him down. But when the parachute is <b>open</b> there's more <b>air resistance</b> and the same force pulling him down. <br><br>His <b>terminal velocity</b> decreases significantly, so he can land safely.",6,0
24,State the <b>first</b> law of motion,"<b>Balanced forces mean no change in velocity</b> <br><br><i>If the forces on an object are <b>balanced</b>, it will carry on moving at the <b>same velocity</b> (this includes staying still).</i>",7,0
25,Objects need a constant overall force to keep moving - true or false?,<b>FALSE</b> <br><br>To keep going at a <b>steady speed</b> there needs to be <b>zero resultant force</b> (forces would be balanced).,7,
26,State Newton's <b>second</b> law of motion,"If there is an <b>unbalanced force</b>, the object will <b>accelerate</b> in that direction <br><br><i>(Note: you get a <b>steady</b> speed from <b>balanced</b> forces but <b>acceleration</b> from an <b>overall</b> force)</i>",7,
27,State the formula for the <b>second</b> law of motion,"F = ma <br><br><i>(F = resultant force, m = mass, a = acceleration)</i>",7,
28,What is Newton's <b>third</b> law of motion?,"If object A <b>exerts a force</b> on object B, then object B exerts <b>the exact opposite force</b> on object A",8,1
29,What's the difference between a <b>vector</b> and <b>scalar</b> quantity?,<b>Vector quantities</b> have a <b>size</b> and <b>direction</b> <br><br><b>Scalar quantities</b> only have a <b>size</b> (no direction),9,1
