1,Define <b>habitat</b>,The <b>place</b> where an organism <b>lives</b>,66,0
2,Define <b>population</b>,<b>All</b> the organisms of <b>one species</b> in a <b>habitat</b>,66,0
3,Define <b>community</b>,All the <b>different species</b> in a habitat,66,0
4,Define <b>ecosystem</b>,"All the <b>organisms</b> living in a <b>particular area</b> and all the <b>non-living</b> (abiotic) <b>conditions</b> - e.g. temperature, climate, soil-type",66,0
5,What is a <b>quadrat</b>?,A square frame enclosing a known area (e.g. 1 m<sup>2</sup>),66,0
6,How can you estimate <b>population sizes</b> using a quadrat?,&bull; Place the <b>quadrat</b> on the ground at a <b>random point</b> within the area you're investigating <br>&bull; <b>Count</b> all the organisms within the quadrat <br>&bull; <b>Multiply</b> the number of organisms by the <b>total area</b> (in m<sup>2</sup>) of the habitat,66,0
7,What two points you should keep in mind when estimating population sizes with quadrats?,"The sample may not be <b>representative</b> of the population (i.e. what you find in your sample may be different from what you'd find if you'd looked at other parts of the habitat) <br><br> The <b>sample size</b> affects the <b>accuracy</b> of the estimate - the bigger your sample, the more accurate your estimate of the total population is likely to be (so you should use the quadrat at several points and get an average, then multiply for the total area)",66,0
8,How can you use quadrats to investigate <b>distribution of organisms</b>?,&bull; <b>Mark out a line</b> in the area you want to study (e.g. from the hedge to the middle of the field) <br>&bull; Then <b>collect data</b> along the line using <b>quadrats</b> placed <b>next to</b> each other,66,0
9,"In a food chain, producers are eaten by...",Primary consumers,67,0
10,"Primary consumers, in a food chain, are eaten by...",Secondary consumers,67,0
11,"In a food chain, secondary consumers get eaten by...",Tertiary consumers,67,0
12,"What is the name given to each stage of a food chain (e.g. producers, primary consumers, etc)?",Trophic levels,67,0
13,What does each bar on a <b>pyramid of numbers</b> represent?,The <b>number of organisms</b> at that stage of the food chain,67,0
14,"On a <b>pyramid of biomass</b>, what does each bar represent?",The <b>mass of living material</b> at that stage of the food chain,67,0
15,What do <b>pyramids of energy transfer</b> show?,They show the <b>energy</b> transferred to each trophic level in a food chain,67,0
16,How is energy lost along a food chain?,&bull; Some parts of food (e.g. roots or bones) <b>aren't eaten</b> by organisms so the energy isn't <b>taken in</b>. <br>&bull; Some parts of food are <b>indigestible</b> (e.g. fibre) so pass through organisms and come out as <b>waste</b> <br>&bull; A lot of the energy that does get taken in is used for <b>staying alive</b> (e.g. <b>respiration</b>) <br>&bull; Most energy is eventually lost as <b>heat</b> <br>&bull; Only around <b>10%</b> of the energy available becomes <b>biomass</b> and gets transferred to the next trophic level,68,0
17,Food webs show how...,Food chains are linked,68,0
18,"Throughout trophic levels, energy is...",Transferred,68,0
19,What does it mean when species in a food web are <b>interdependent</b>?,"If one species changes (e.g. population decrease), it <b>affects all the others</b>",68,0
20,Draw a diagram showing the <b>water cycle</b>,#see-guide,69,1
21,Describe the <b>water cycle</b>,"<br>&bull; <b>Heat</b> from the <b>Sun</b> makes water <b>evaporate</b> from the land and sea, turning it into <b>water vapour</b> (water also evaporates from plants - <b>transpiration</b>) <br>&bull; The warm water vapour is <b>carried upwards</b> (as warm air rises), and when it gets higher up, it <b>cools</b> and <b>condenses</b>, forming <b>clouds</b> <br>&bull; Water falls from the clouds as <b>precipitation</b> (rain, but sometimes snow/hail) and is <b>returned</b> to the land and sea",69,1
22,Draw a diagram of the <b>carbon cycle</b>,#see-guide,69,0
23,Describe the <b>carbon cycle</b>,"&bull; <b>Plants</b> use carbon dioxide from the air to make <b>carbohydrates, fats</b> and <b>proteins</b> <br>&bull; <b>Eating</b> passes the carbon compounds in the plant along to <b>animals</b> <br>&bull; Plants and animals <b>respire</b> which <b>releases CO<sub>2</sub></b> back into the air <br>&bull; <b>Decomposers</b> also release CO<sub>2</sub> as they break down dead plants and animals <br>&bull; Useful plant and animal <b>products</b> (e.g. wood and fossil fuels) are burned (<b>combustion</b>) which also releases <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b> back into the air",69,0
24,Draw a diagram of the <b>nitrogen cycle</b>,#see-guide,70,1
25,What is <b>nitrogen fixation</b>?,The process of turning <b>N<sub>2</sub> from the air</b> into <b>nitrogen compounds</b> in the soil which <b>plants can use</b> <br><br>This can happen either during <b>lightning</b> or by <b>nitrogen-fixing bacteria</b> in the roots and soil,70,1
26,List the <b>four</b> different types of <b>bacteria</b> involved in the nitrogen cycle,&bull; Decomposers <br>&bull; Nitrifying bacteria <br>&bull; Nitrogen-fixing bacteria <br>&bull; Denitrifying bacteria,70,1
27,What is the role of <b>decomposers</b> in the nitrogen cycle?,To break down <b>proteins</b> (in rotting plants and animals) and <b>urea</b> (in animal waste) and turn them into <b>ammonia</b> (a nitrogen compound),70,1
28,What do <b>nitrifying bacteria</b> do?,Turn <b>ammonia</b> in decaying matter into <b>nitrates</b>,70,1
29,How does <b>nitrogen-fixing bacteria</b> contribute to the nitrogen cycle?,They turn <b>atmospheric N<sub>2</sub></b> into <b>nitrogen compounds</b> that plants can use,70,1
30,What do <b>denitrifying bacteria</b> do?,Turn <b>nitrates</b> back into <b>N<sub>2</sub> gas</b>. This doesn't benefit living organisms.,70,1
31,Why does nitrogen in the air needed to be turned into <b>nitrogen compounds</b>?,<b>Plants</b> get their nitrogen from the <b>soil</b> as nitrogen compounds (e.g. <b>nitrates</b>),70,1
32,Why is nitrogen needed in living organisms?,It is needed for making <b>proteins</b> for <b>growth</b>,70,1
33,"When fossil fuels are burnt <b>without</b> air supply, they produce...","<b>Carbon monoxide</b> (CO), a poisonous gas",71,0
34,Carbon monoxide's mostly released by...,<b>Car emissions</b> <br><br>(but most modern cars are fitted with <b>catalytic converters</b> which convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide),71,0
35,Burning fossil fuels releases harmful gases like...,<b>Carbon dioxide</b> and <b>sulfur dioxide</b> <br><br>(the sulfur comes from <b>sulfur impurities</b> in fossil fuels),71,0
36,Which compound causes <b>acid rain</b>?,Sulfur dioxide,71,0
37,What are the main causes of acid rain?,<b>Internal combustion engines</b> in cars and <b>power station</b>,71,0
38,What are the effects of acid rain on the environment?,"&bull; It can cause a <b>lake</b> to become more <b>acidic</b>, having a severe effect on the lake's <b>ecosystem</b>. Many organisms are sensitive to <b>changes in pH</b> and <b>can't survive</b> in more acidic conditions <br><br>&bull; It can kill <b>trees</b>: the acid <b>damages leaves</b> and releases <b>toxic substances</b> from the soil, making it hard for the trees to take up nutrients.",71,0
39,Draw a diagram showing the <b>greenhouse effect</b>,#see-guide,72,0
40,Describe the greenhouse effect,"Gases in the atmosphere help keep <b>heat in</b> the Earth. <br><br>These gases include <b>water vapour, carbon dioxide</b> and <b>methane</b>",72,0
41,How do humans increase the amount of <b>carbon dioxide</b> in the atmosphere?,&bull; Deforestation <br>&bull; From car exhausts <br>&bull; Industrial processes (like burning fossil fuels),72,0
42,How is <b>methane gas</b> released into the atmosphere?,&bull; <b>Naturally</b> (from rotting plants in marshland) <br>&bull; From <b>man-made</b> sources: <b>rice growing</b> and <b>cattle rearing</b> ,72,0
43,How is <b>nitrous oxide</b> released into the atmosphere?,"&bull; Naturally, by <b>bacteria</b> in <b>soils</b> and the <b>ocean</b> <br>&bull; A lot more is released from soils after <b>fertiliser</b> is used <br>&bull; It's also released from <b>vehicle engines</b> and industry",72,0
44,What are <b>CFCs</b> and how are they released into the atmosphere?,"&bull; <b>CFCs</b> are <b>man-made</b> chemicals that were once used in <b>aerosol sprays</b> (e.g. deodarant), and <b>fridges</b>. They are powerful greenhouse gases. <br>&bull; They damage the <b>ozone layer</b> <br>&bull; Some CFCs still get released, e.g. by <b>leaks</b> from old fridges",72,0
45,Why can fertiliser cause problems when they end up in lakes and rivers?,"&bull; <b>Nitrates</b> and <b>phosphates</b> are put onto fields as <b>mineral fertilisers</b> <br>&bull; If <b>too much fertiliser</b> is applied and it <b>rains</b> afterwards, nitrates are easily <b>leached</b> (washed through the soil) into rivers and lakes <br>&bull; The result is <b>eutrophication</b>, which can cause serious damage to rivers and lakes",73,0
46,What is another cause of <b>eutrophication</b> (apart from leaching)?,"Pollution by <b>sewage</b>. <br><br>&bull; Sewage contains lots of <b>phosphates</b> from detergents (e.g. washing powder), and <b>nitrates</b> from urine and faeces <br>&bull; These extra nutrients cause eutrophication in the <b>same way that fertilisers do</b>.",73,1
47,How does deforestation affect <b>leaching</b>?,"&bull; Trees <b>take up nutrients</b> from the soil <b>before</b> they can be <b>washed away</b> (leached) by rain, but return them to the soil when leaves die <br>&bull; When trees are removed nutrients get <b>leached away</b> but <b>don't</b> get <b>replaced</b>, leaving <b>infertile soil</b>",73,0
48,How does deforestation affect <b>soil erosion</b>?,"&bull; Tree roots <b>hold the soil together</b> <br>&bull; When trees are <b>removed</b>, soil can be <b>washed away</b> by the rain (<b>eroded</b>) leaving <b>infertile</b> ground",73,0
49,How does deforestation disturb the <b>water cycle</b>?,"&bull; Trees <b>stop rainwater</b> reaching rivers too quickly <br>&bull; When they're cut down, rainwater can run <b>straight into rivers</b> - this can lead to <b>flooding/b> <br>&bull; <b>Transpiration</b> from trees releases some of the rainwater <b>back into</b> the <b>atmosphere</b> <br>&bull; When they're cut down this can make the <b>local climate drier</b>",73,0
50,How does deforestation disturb the balance of <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>oxygen</b>?,"&bull; Forests take up CO<sub>2</sub> (via photosynthesis), and slowly release it when they <b>decompose</b> <br>&bull; When trees are cut down and <b>burnt</b>, the stored carbon is <b>released</b> which contributes to <b>global warming</b> <br>&bull; Fewer trees in the forest also means that <b>less photosynthesis</b> takes place, releasing <b>less oxygen</b>, which causes oxygen levels in the atmosphere to <b>drop</b>.",73,0
