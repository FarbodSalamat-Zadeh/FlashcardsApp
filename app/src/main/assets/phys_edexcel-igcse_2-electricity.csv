1,How can you ensure plugs are wired correctly?,"&bull; The <b>right coloured wire</b> is connected to each pin, and <b>firmly screwed</b> in. <br>&bull; <b>No bare wire</b> are showing inside a plug. <br>&bull; The <b>cable grip</b> is tightly fastened over the cable <b>outer layer</b>.",18,0
2,What are the parts of a plug made of and why?,"&bull; The <b>metal parts</b> are made of copper and brass because these are <b>very good conductors</b>. <br>&bull; The case, cable grip and insulation are made of <b>rubber</b> or <b>plastic</b> because they're really good <b>insulators</b>, and <b>flexible</b> too.",18,0
3,List the three wires in a plug,&bull; Live wire <br>&bull; Neutral wire <br>&bull; Earth wire,18,0
4,What does the <b>live</b> wire do?,Alternates between a <b>high +ve and -ve voltage</b> of about <b>230 V</b>,18,0
5,What does the <b>neutral</b> wire do?,It is always at <b>0 V</b>. <br><br>Electricity normally flows in through the live wire and out through the neutral wire.,18,0
6,"In a plug, what does the <b>earth wire</b> do?",This wire and <b>fuse</b> (or circuit breaker) are just for <b>safety</b> and <b>work together</b>.,18,0
7,"If the appliance has a <b>plastic casing</b> and no metal parts are showing, it is said to be...",Double insulated,18,0
8,What precautions should you take when using plugs?,&bull; Check it isn't <b>damaged</b> so that <b>live parts</b> aren't exposed (this prevents an electric shock) <br>&bull; Check the cable isn't <b>frayed</b> <br>&bull; Check the cables aren't <b>too long</b> for the appliance (trip hazard) <br>&bull; Check there's <b>no water</b> near electrical objects (water is a good <b>conductor</b>) <br>&bull; Never push a <b>metal</b> object into a plug <b>socket</b> (unless it's the pins of the plug),18,0
9,How does earthing and fuses prevent fires and shocks?,"&bull; If a <b>fault</b> develops in which the <b>live</b> somehow touches the <b>metal case</b>, then because the case is <b>earthed</b>, a <b>big current</b> flows in through the <b>live</b>, through the <b>case</b> and out down the <b>earth wire</b>. <br>&bull; This <b>surge</b> in current <b>'blows' (melts) the fuse</b> (or trips the circuit breaker) which <b>cuts off</b> the <b>live supply</b>. <br>&bull; This <b>isolates</b> the <b>whole appliance</b>, making it <b>impossible</b> to get an electric <b>shock</b> from the case. It also prevents the risk of <b>fire</b> caused by the heating effect of a large current.",19,0
10,"How do circuit breakers work, and what are their advantages over fuses?","&bull; When they detect a <b>surge</b> in <b>current</b> in a circuit, they break the circuit by <b>opening</b> a <b>switch</b>. <br>&bull; Circuit breakers (and the circuit) can be <b>reset</b> by flicking a <b>switch</b> so they are <b>more convenient</b> than fuses (which need to be replaced once they've melted)",19,0
11,Name one type of circuit breaker,Residual Current Circuit Breaker (<b>RCCB</b>),19,0
12,Explain how a RCCB works,#see-guide,19,0
13,Explain how resistors get hot,"&bull; When there is an <b>electric current</b> in a <b>resistor</b> there is an <b>energy transfer</b> which heats the resistor. <br>&bull; This <b>heating effect</b> increases the resistor's <b>resistance</b> so <b>less current</b> will flow, or a <b>greater voltage</b> will be needed to produce the same current. <br>&bull; This heating effect can cause <b>components</b> in the circuit to <b>melt</b> - which means the circuit will <b>stop</b> working, or <b>not work properly</b>. <br>&bull; <b>Fuses</b> use this effect to <b>protect</b> circuits - they <b>melt</b> and <b>break</b> the circuit if the current gets too high.",20,0
14,How can you use the heating effect of an electric current to heat things?,"The <b>heating effect</b> of an electric current has <b>advantage</b> such as when you want to <b>heat</b> something. <br><br><b>Toasters</b> contain a coil of wire with a really <b>high</b> resistance. When a current passes through the coil, its <b>temperature increases</b> so it <b>glows</b> and gives off <b>infrared</b> (heat) radiation which <b>cooks</b> the bread.",20,0
