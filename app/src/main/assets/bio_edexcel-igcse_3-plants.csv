1,What process do plants use to make their own food?,Photosynthesis,19,0
2,In which organelle does photosynthesis occur in?,Chloroplasts,19,0
3,What is the formula for the photosynthesis?,Carbon dioxide + water &rarr; glucose + oxygen <br><br>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> <br><br>(Note: Photosynthesis only works with <b>sunlight</b> and <b>chlorophyll</b>),19,0
4,How are leaves adapted for efficient photosynthesis?,"&bull; Leaves are <b>broad</b> so there's a <b>large surface area</b> exposed to light <br>&bull; Most chloroplasts are in the <b>palisade mesophyll</b> layer (they're near the top of the leaf where they can get the most light) <br>&bull; The <b>upper epidermis</b> is <b>transparent</b> so light can pass through to the palisade layer <br>&bull; Leaves have <b>vascular bundles</b> that support the leaf structure and deliver water and nutrients <br>&bull; The <b>waxy cuticle</b> helps to <b>reduce water loss</b> by evaporation <br>&bull; The lower surface, full of holes called <b>stomata</b>, make gas exchange happen faster",19,0
5,What is a <b>limiting factor</b>?,Something which <b>stops photosynthesis from happening any faster</b>. <br><br>It depends on environmental conditions.,20,0
6,List some examples of limiting factors,&bull; Not enough <b>light</b> slows down the rate of photosynthesis <br>&bull; Too little <b>carbon dioxide</b> slows it down <br>&bull; The <b>temperature</b> has to be just right (otherwise enzymes get denatured),20,0
7,How can you test a leaf for starch?,"&bull; <b>Kill</b> the leaf by dunking it in <b>boiling water</b>  (this stops chemical reactions in the leaf) <br>&bull; Put the leaf in some <b>ethanol</b> and <b>heat</b> it in a water bath. This is for getting rid of chlorophyll, so the leaf ends up a pale, white-ish colour. <br>&bull; <b>Rinse</b> the leaf in <b>cold water</b> and add a few drops of <b>iodine solution</b> to it. <br>&bull; If <b>starch</b> is <b>present</b>, it will turn <b>blue-black</b>.",21,0
8,What can the starch test show on a leaf?,Whether photosynthesis is taking place,21,0
9,How would you prove that <b>chlorophyll</b> is needed for photosynthesis?,&bull; Take a variegated (green and white) leaf from a plant that's been <b>exposed to light</b>. Remember to <b>record</b> which parts are green. <br>&bull; <b>Test the leaf</b> for starch - only the green parts of the leaf go <b>blue-black</b>. <br>&bull; This suggests that only the parts of the leaf that <b>contained chlorophyll</b> were able to <b>photosynthesise</b> and produce starch.,21,0
10,Describe an experiment to prove <b>carbon dioxide</b> is needed for photosynthesis,"&bull; Find a plant and place some soda lime next to it. Put a sealed jar over these and shine some light at it. <br>&bull; The soda lime will <b>absorb CO2</b> out of the air in the jar. <br>&bull; If you leave the plant for in the jar for a while and then <b>test</b> a leaf for starch, it <b>won't</b> turn blue-black. <br>&bull; This shows that <b>no starch</b> has been made in the leaf, which means that <b>CO2 is needed</b> for photosynthesis.",21,0
11,How can you show <b>light</b> is needed for photosynthesis?,"&bull; Find a plant that's been grown <b>without light</b> (remember it should still have the right amount of heat, CO2, and water and nutrients). <br>&bull; Cut a leaf from it and <b>test</b> it for starch - the leaf <b>won't</b> turn blue-black. <br>&bull; This shows that <b>light is needed</b> for photosynthesis, as no starch has been made.",22,0
12,Describe an experiment to measure the rate of photosynthesis,"&bull; Put some Canadian pondweed in a test tube containing water, connected to a gas syringe. <br>&bull; A source of <b>white light</b> is placed at a <b>specific distance</b> from the pondweed. <br>&bull; Leave the pondweed to photosynthesise for a set amount of time and <b>oxygen is released</b>. <br>&bull; Use the syringe to draw the gas in and the length of <b>gas bubble</b> is <b>measured</b>. <br>&bull; Repeat the experiment, only changing the <b>distance</b> from the pondweed that the <b>light source</b> is placed at.",22,0
13,What four minerals do plants need for growth?,&bull; Nitrates <br>&bull; Phosphates <br>&bull; Potassium <br>&bull; Magnesium,23,0
14,Why do plants need <b>nitrates</b>?,"They contain nitrogen for making <b>amino acids</b> and <b>proteins</b>. These are needed for <b>cell growth</b>. <br><br>If the plant can't get enough nitrates, it will be <b>stunted</b> and have <b>yellow older leaves</b>.",23,0
15,Why are <b>phosphates</b> important for plants?,"They contain phosphorus for making <b>DNA</b> and <b>cell membranes</b>, and they're needed for <b>respiration</b> and <b>growth</b>. <br><br>Plants without enough phosphates have <b>poor root growth</b> and <b>purple older leaves</b>.",23,0
16,Why is <b>potassium</b> needed in plants?,"They help the <b>enzymes</b> needed for <b>photosynthesis</b> and <b>respiration</b>. <br><br>If there's not enough potassium in the soil, plants have <b>poor flower and fruit growth</b> and <b>discoloured leaves</b>.",23,0
17,"Magnesium is not one of the three <em>main</em> minerals, but is still important. Why?","While it is only needed in <b>smaller</b> amounts, magnesium is required for making <b>chlorophyll</b> (needed for photosynthesis). <br><br>Plants without magnesium have <b>yellow leaves</b>.",23,0
18,Why do multicellular organisms need <b>transport systems</b>?,"To transport substances such as nutrients to different parts of the organism (diffusion, like in single-celled organisms, would be too slow).",24,0
19,What are the two main transport systems in plants?,&bull; Xylem <br>&bull; Phloem,24,0
20,What is the <b>xylem</b> used for in plants?,To carry <b>water</b> and <b>mineral salts</b> from the roots up to the shoot to the leaves in the <b>transpiration stream</b>.,24,0
21,What are the <b>phloem</b> tubes used for?,"To transport sugars, like <b>sucrose</b>, and <b>amino acids</b> from where they're made in the leaves to other parts of the plant.",24,1
22,Define <b>translocation</b>,The <b>movement</b> of food substances around the plant (through the <b>phloem</b> tubes),24,1
23,What are <b>root hair</b> cells?,&bull; The cells on plant roots grow into long <b>'hairs'</b> which stick out into the soil. <br>&bull; Each branch of a root will be covered in <b>millions</b> of these microscopic hairs. <br>&bull; This gives the plant a <b>big surface area</b> for <b>absorbing water</b> from the soil.,24,0
24,How do plants draw in water?,Water is <b>drawn into</b> root hair cells by <b>osmosis</b>. <br><br>This is because there's usually a <b>higher concentration</b> of water in the <b>soil</b> than there is inside the plant.,24,0
25,Define <b>transpiration</b>,"The <b>loss of water<b> from the plant <br><br>When plants lose water, more water is drawn up from the rest of the plant through the <b>xylem</b> vessels to replace it. This results in more water being drawn up from the <b>roots</b> - and so there's a constant <b>transpiration stream</b> of water through the plant.",25,0
26,How do plants lose water?,Evaporation and diffusion from a plant's surface,25,0
27,Transpiration rate is affected by four main things. What are these?,&bull; Light intensity <br>&bull; Temperature <br>&bull; Wind speed <br>&bull; Humidity,25,0
28,How is transpiration rate affected by <b>light intensity</b>?,"The <b>brighter</b> the light, the <b>greater</b> the transpiration rate. <br><br><b>Stomata</b> begin to <b>close</b> as it gets darker. Photosynthesis can't happen in  the dark, so they don't need to be open to let <b>CO<sub>2</sub></b> in. When the stomata are closed, very little water can escape.",25,0
29,How does <b>temperature</b> affect transpiration rate?,"The <b>warmer</b> it is, the <b>faster</b> transpiration happens. <br><br>When it's warm, the water particles have <b>more energy</b> to evaporate and diffuse out of the stomata.",25,0
30,How is transpiration rate affected by <b>wind speed</b>?,"The <b>higher</b> the wind speed around a leaf, the <b>greater</b> the transpiration rate. <br><br>If the wind speed around a leaf is <b>low</b>, the water vapour just <b>surrounds the leaf</b> and doesn't move away (high concentration of water particles outside the leaf). <b>Diffusion</b> happens more slowly. But if water vapour is swept away, there will be a low concentration of water outside the leaf and diffusion can happen quickly.",25,0
31,<b>Humidity</b> affects transpiration rate. How?,"The <b>drier</b> the air around a leaf, the <b>faster</b> transpiration happens. <br><br>If the air is <b>humid</b>, there's a lot of water in it already, so there's little <b>difference</b> between the inside and outside of the leaf. Diffusion happens <b>fastest</b> at higher <b>concentration gradients</b>.",25,0
32,What piece of apparatus can be used to estimate <b>transpiration rate</b>?,A <b>potometer</b>,26,0
33,How does a <b>potometer</b> measure transpiration rate?,It measures <b>water uptake</b> (which is assumed is directly related to water loss).,26,0
