8,Which type of cell division is involved in <b>asexual</b> reproduction?,Mitosis,52,0
9,Describe <b>asexual reproduction</b> (in general),It involves only <b>one</b> parent. The offspring have <b>identical genes</b> to the parent - so there's <b>no variation</b> between parent and offspring.,52,0
10,Define <b>mitosis</b>,A cell reproduces itself by <b>splitting</b> to form <b>two cells</b> with <b>identical sets of chromosomes</b>,52,0
11,Describe the process of <b>mitosis</b>,"&bull; If the cell gets a signal to <b>divide</b>, it <b>duplicates</b> its DNA (so there's one copy for each cell). The DNA forms <b>X-shaped</b> chromosomes. <br>&bull; The chromosomes <b>line up</b> at the centre of the cell and <b>cell fibres</b> pull them apart. The <b>two arms</b> of each chromosome go to <b>opposite ends</b> of the cell. <br>&bull<b>Membranes</b> form around each of the sets of chromosomes.

17,Which type of cell division is involved in <b>sexual</b> reproduction?,Meiosis,53,0
18,Define <b>meiosis</b>,A process which produces <b>four haploid cells</b> whose chromosomes are <b>not identical</b>,53,0
19,Describe the process of <b>meiosis</b>,"&bull; The cell <b>duplicates</b> its <b>DNA</b>. <br<&bull; The chromosomes <b>line up</b> in pairs in the centre of the cell before being <b>pulled apart</b> (so each new cell only has one copy of each chromosome) <br>&bull; Each new cell will have a <b>mixture</b> of the mother's and father's chromosomes, creating <b>variation</b> in the offspring. <br>&bull; Chromosomes <b>line up again</b> and the <b>arms</b> of the chromosomes are <b>pulled apart</b> <br>&bull; The result is <b>four haploid gametes</b> where each only has a <b>single set</b> of chromosomes. The gametes are <b>genetically different</b>",53,0

The stigma often <b>hangs outside</b> the flower too.",54,0
30,How does fertilisation occur in plants?,"&bull; A <b>pollen</b> grain lands on the <b>stigma</b> of a flower, usually with help from insects or the wind. <br>&bull; A <b>pollen tube</b> grows out of the pollen grain and down through the <b>style</b> to the <b>ovary</b> and into the <b>ovule</b>. <br>&bull; A <b>nucleus</b> from the male gamete <b>moves down the tube</b> to join with a female gamete in the <b>ovule</b>. <b>Fertilisation</b> is when the two nuclei <b>fuse</b> together to make a zygote. This divides by mitosis to form an <b>embryo</b>. <br>&bull; Each <b>fertilised</b> female gamete forms a <b>seed</b>. The <b>ovary</b> develops into a <b>fruit</b> around the seed.",55,0
31,Germination is...,When <b>seeds start</b> to <b>grow</b>,55,1

35,Give an example of how plants can reproduce <b>asexually</b> using <b>natural methods</b>,"&bull; Strawberry plants send out <b>runners</b> - <b>fast growing stems</b> that grow out <b>sideways</b>, just above the ground <br>&bull; The runners <b>take root</b> at various points, and <b>new plants</b> start to grow. <br.&bull; The new plants are <b>clones</b> of the <b>parent</b> strawberry plant, so there's <b>no genetic variation</b>.",56,0
36,How can we clone plants artificially?,"&bull; Gardeners can take <b>cuttings</b> from good parent plants, and then plant them to produce <b>genetically identical copies</b> (clones) of the parent plant. <br>&bull; These plants can be produced <b>quickly and cheaply</b>.",56,0
