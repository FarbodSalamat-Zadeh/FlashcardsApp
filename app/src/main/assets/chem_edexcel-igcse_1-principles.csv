The gases (NH3 and HCl) diffuse and meet closer to where the hydrochloric acid was. This is because ammonia particles are lighter so they diffuse more quickly. <br><br><b>Bromine Gas and Air</b>:<br>Fill half a gas jar with bromine gas (which is brown colour), and the other half full of air - separate these with a glass plate. When the glass plate is removed, you can see the brown bromine gas slowly diffusing through the air.",2,0

69,Ionic compounds only conduct electricity when...,<b>Molten</b> or in a <b>solution</b>,25,0
70,Why can't <em>solid</em> ionic compounds conduct electricity?,"<b>Solid</b> ionic compounds <b>don't</b> conduct electricity because the ions <b>aren't</b> free to move around. <br><br>When an ionic compound is <b>dissolved</b> the ions separate and are <b>free to move</b> in the <b>solution</b>, so they'll carry <b>electric current</b> and so <b>conduct electricity</b>. <br>Similarly, when an ionic compound <b>melts</b>, the ions are also free to move and will carry electric current.",25,0
