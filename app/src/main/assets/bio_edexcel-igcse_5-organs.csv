1,What are the four main components of blood?,&bull; Plasma <br>&bull; Platelets <br>&bull; Red blood cells <br>&bull; White blood cells,35,0
2,What is <b>plasma</b>?,The pale yellow liquid that <b>carries just about everything</b> that needs transporting around your body <br><br>(You could say it's the blood minus the blood cells),35,0
3,What does plasma carry?,"&bull; Red and white blood cells (and platelets) <br>&bull; Digested food products (e.g. glucose, amino acids) <br>&bull; Carbon dioxide <br>&bull; Urea <br>&bull; Hormones <br>&bull; Heat energy",35,0
4,Describe <b>platelets</b>,They are <b>small fragments</b> of cells that <b>help blood clot</b>. <br><br>Platelets clump together to 'plug' damaged blood vessels (<b>blood clotting</b>). This <b>stops you losing</b> too much <b>blood</b> and prevent <b>microorganisms</b> from entering the wound.,35,1
5,"In blood clots, platelets are held together my a mesh of protein called...",<b>Fibrin</b> (this process needs other proteins called <b>clotting factors</b> to work properly).,35,1
6,What do <b>red blood cells</b> do?,They transport <b>oxygen</b> from the <b>lungs</b> to <b>all</b> the cells in the body,35,0
7,How are red blood cells <b>well-adapted</b> to its function?,"&bull; <b>Small</b> and <b>biconcave shape</b> for a <b>large surface area</b> for absorbing and releasing oxygen <br>&bull; They contain <b>haemoglobin</b> which contain lots of <b>iron</b> (and it also gives blood its red colour). In the lungs, it reacts with oxygen to become <b>oxyhaemoglobin</b>, and the reverse happens in body tissues to release oxygen <br>&bull; They have <b>no nucleus</b> so there's <b>more space</b> for more haemoglobin so more oxygen can be carried",35,0
8,Name the two main types of white blood cells,<b>Phagocytes</b> and <b>lymphocytes</b>,36,0
9,What do <b>phagocytes</b> do?,"<b>Ingest pathogens</b> <br><br>(They detect things foreign to the body and engulf them and digest them, attacking anything that's not meant to be there)",36,0
10,What is the function of <b>lymphocytes</b>?,<b>Producing antibodies</b> <br><br>&bull; They produce proteins called <b>antibodies</b> that lock onto the pathogens and mark them for destruction. <br>&bull; Antibodies are <b>specific</b> to the antigen (so they won't work on other pathogens) <br>&bull; They are produced rapidly to mark similar pathogens <br>&bull; Some remain as <b>memory cells</b> to reproduce the <b>same antigen</b> if it enters the body again. This makes the body <b>immune</b>.,36,0
11,How do <b>vaccinations</b> work?,"&bull; When you're infectioned with <b>new pathogens</b>, it takes time for the lymphocytes to produce antibodies (so you could get very ill) <br>&bull; <b>Vaccination</b> involves injecting <b>dead/inactive</b> pathogens which will still trigger an <b>immune response</b> even though they're <b>harmless</b>",36,1
12,List the <b>three</b> main types of <b>blood vessels</b>,&bull; <b>Arteries</b> carry blood <b>away</b> from the heart <br>&bull; <b>Capillaries</b> are involved in the <b>exchange of materials</b> at the tissues <br>&bull; <b>Veins</b> carry the blood <b>to</b> the heary,37,0
13,How are <b>arteries</b> well-adapted for their function?,&bull; <b>Strong</b> and <b>elastic</b> walls for <b>high pressures</b> of blood <br>&bull; <b>Thick</b> walls containing thick layers of <b>muscle</b> to make them <b>strong</b>,37,0
14,What is the name of the <b>largest artery</b> in the body?,The <b>aorta</b>,37,0
15,Describe how <b>capillaries</b> are well-adapted,"&bull; They carry blood <b>really close</b> to every cell to <b>exchange substances</b> with them <br>&bull; <b>Permeable</b> walls allow substances to <b>diffuse</b> in and out <br>&bull; They supply <b>food</b> and <b>oxygen</b>, and take away <b>wastes like CO<sub>2</sub></b> <br>&bull; The walls are usually <b>one cell thick</b> which <b>increases</b> the rate of diffusion by <b>decreasing</b> the <b>distance</b> over which it happens",37,0
16,What properties of <b>veins</b> make them good for their function?,&bull; <b>Thinner</b> walls because of <b>lower blood pressures</b> <br>&bull; They have <b>larger lumens</b> than help the blood <b>flow</b> despite lower pressures <br>&bull; <b>Valves</b> help keep blood flowing in the <b>right direction</b>,37,0
17,Name the <b>largest vein</b> in the body,The <b>vena cava</b>,37,0
18,Label a diagram of the heart,#see-guide,38,0
19,How does exercise increases heart rate?,"&bull; When you <b>exercise</b>, your muscles need <b>more energy</b>, so you <b>respire more</b> <br>&bull; You need to get <b>more oxygen</b> into the cells and <b>remove</b> more <b>carbon dioxide</b> <br>&bull; So blood has to flow faster and <b>heart rate increases</b>",38,0
20,How does the <b>hormonal system</b> help control heart rate?,"&bull; The <b>adrenal glands</b> release <b>adrenaline</b> when an organism is threatened by a predator <br>&bull; Adrenaline <b>binds</b> to <b>specific receptors</b> in the <b>heart</b> causing the cardiac muscle to <b>contract more frequently</b> and with <b>more force</b> - so heart rate increases and the heart pumps more blood <br>&bull; This <b>increases oxygen supply</b> to tissues, getting the body <b>ready for action</b>",38,0
21,Label a diagram of the <b>circulation system</b>,#see-guide,39,0
22,What are the <b>three</b> main roles of the <b>kidneys</b>?,&bull; <b>Removal of urea</b> from the blood. Urea is produced in the <b>liver</b> from <b>excess amino acids</b> <br>&bull; Adjustment of <b>salt levels</b> in the blood <br>&bull; Adjustment of <b>water content</b> of the blood,40,0
23,List the <b>three</b> main processes that take place in the <b>nephrons</b>,&bull; Ultrafiltration <br>&bull; Reabsorption <br>&bull; Release of wastes,40,0
24,Label a diagram of a single nephron,#see-guide,40,0
25,Describe <b>ultrafiltration</b>,"&bull; Blood from the <b>renal artery</b> flows through the <b>glomerulus</b> (bundle of capillaries at the start of the nephron) <br>&bull; <b>High pressure</b> builds up which squeezes <b>water, urea, salts</b> and <b>glucose</b> out of the blood and into the <b>Bowman's capsule</b> <br>&bull; The membranes between the blood vessels in the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule act like <b>filters</b>, so <b>larger molecules</b> (like proteins and blood cells) are <b>not squeezed out</b> - they stay in the blood. The <b>filtered liquid</b> in the Bowman's capsule is known as the <b>glomerular filtrate</b>.",40,0
26,What is <b>reabsorption</b>?,"As the filtrate flows along the nephron, <b>useful</b> substances are <b>selectively reabsorbed</b> back into the blood: <br>&bull; <b>All glucose</b> is reabsorbed from the <b>proximal convoluted tubule</b> (involving active transport) <br>&bull; <b>Sufficient salt</b> is reabsorbed, excess salt isn't <br>&bull; <b>Sufficient water</b> is reabsorbed from the <b>collecting duct</b> into the bloodstream",40,0
27,How does the nephron <b>release wastes</b>?,"The remaining substances (<b>water, salts and urea</b>) form <b>urine</b>. This continues out of the <b>nephron</b>, through the ureter and down to the <b>bladder</b>, where it is stored before being released via the <b>urethra</b>.",40,0
28,How is water lost in the body?,&bull; Sweating <br>&bull; Breathing <br>&bull; Weeing,41,0
29,The body needs to <b>constantly balance</b> water in the body. This is called...,Osmoregulation,41,0
30,Which hormone controls the amount of water reabsorbed in the kidney nephrons?,<b>ADH</b> (anti-diuretic hormone),41,0
31,Which gland releases <b>ADH</b>?,The <b>pituitary gland</b>,41,0
32,How does <b>ADH</b> help control water content?,Here is an example of actions taken by the body: <br>&bull; Brain detects <b>water gain</b> <br>&bull; Pituitary gland releases <b>less ADH</b> <br>&bull; Lack of ADH means kidney reabsorbs <b>less water</b> <br>&bull; The body becomes <b>hydrated</b>,41,0
